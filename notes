                        As long as I can remember, I have always had the urge to create. I actaully go into depression when I go through spans of life where I am not making anything. I've always had a knack for creating figurative/organic images but have always struggled with hard lines like in architecture. I like to work in many mediums and styles but have found a real joy in painting. I do a lot of portraits and what I find most interesting is that in creating each piece it is like I am spending time with the individual who I am painting. I have found this to be very theraputic, especially when the portrait is of someone who has passed or someone I dont know. It's as if we are building a relationship.

                    I have always had a curiosity for tech and the tech industry but never had the courage to go out and seek the knowledge. My first experience with some minor coding was with Myspace and I remember loving how creative you could be with all of the little flare you could add to your profile. I had a spider-man animation that would slink down the page on his web and cool videos and songs would play when you scrolled over them. Since then though, I haven't done anything with tech.

                    It wasn't until recently when I decided to leave my GM gig where I swore to never work in the food industry again that I got the guts to try someyhing new. I left my job in December 2021 and then I focused on completeing my BFA in painting at Old Dominion University where I graduated in May 2022. I love making art but I never wanted to have to depend on it as a main income so I decided to mess around with some free coding websites. Soon after graduation I was contacted by a company called Genesis Dev10 where they were supposed to pay me to learn and then place me in a job. I applied but it never felt right to me because the contract was horrible and the pay was so low to have to live in such expensive cities. However, I still applied for the job but ended up intentionally bombing the interview project after talking with a freind in the field. It was my freind who convinced me to do a bootcamp and this is what lead me to Coding Temple.
