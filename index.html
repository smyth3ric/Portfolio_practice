                    Hi! My name is Eric Smith. 
                <br>
                    I am a life long creative with a passion for painting, basketball, travel, and food. I sell art on the side but I've mostly spent the last 20 years working in the service industry where I've done every position from dishwasher to general manager. I love watching television shows, movies, and plays, and when I can find the time I really enjoy reading books. Basically, I'm into any artform that can transport me into another world.
                        
                <br>
                    I currently reside in Norfolk, VA where I am always on the search for adventure with my wife Rachel, daughter Esme, and dog Panda.

                            <h3>ART</h3>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                As long as I can remember, I have always had the urge to create. I actaully go into depression when I go through spans of life where I am not making anything. I've always had a knack for creating figurative/organic images but have always struggled with hard lines like in architecture. I like to work in many mediums and styles but have found a real joy in painting. I do a lot of portraits and what I find most interesting is that in creating each piece it is like I am spending time with the individual who I am painting. I have found this to be very theraputic, especially when the portrait is of someone who has passed or someone I dont know. It's as if we are building a relationship.

                                Basketball was my first love!
                                I've been playing non-stop since I was maybe 7 and I am 36 now so it's been a long time. When I was young, my friends and I would play from sun up to sun down and then go find somewhere with lights to play at night. I only get to play once a week now because of "adulting" and my body hurts but I still get it done. I'm crafty, my float game is fire, and I have a killer jumpshot. I've been compared to the likes of Manu Ginobli, Peja Stojakovic, Kobe, and as of last week, I was told that I have game like Luka. <br>

                            <br>

                            <p>The world is an amazing place full of amazing people, places, cultures, wildlife and an endless number of things and I want to see it all. I doubt that it will ever happen but it is my intention to try. A few of the palces that I have been to are Italy, Monaco, Dubai, and Peru. I've been to the Vatican City, to the top of the Burj Khalifa,
                            and had the opportunity to be apart of hosting a party for the Prince of Monaco. However, my most memorable adventure was doing a 5 day guided hike with my wife through the mountains and jungles of Peru to get to Machu Picchu. 22,000 feet above sea level is no joke and altitude sickness is the worst feeling I've ever had but I would do the trip 10 more times if I had the opportunity.

                I have always had a curiosity for tech and the tech industry but never had the courage to go out and seek the knowledge. My first experience with some minor coding was with Myspace and I remember loving how creative you could be with all of the little flare you could add to your profile. I had a spider-man animation that would slink down the page on his web and cool videos and songs would play when you scrolled over them. Since then though, I haven't done anything with tech. 
                <br>
                It wasn't until recently when I decided to leave my GM gig where I swore to never work in the food industry again that I got the guts to try someyhing new. I left my job in December 2021 and then I focused on completeing my BFA in painting at Old Dominion University where I graduated in May 2022. I love making art but I never wanted to have to depend on it as a main income so I decided to mess around with some free coding websites. Soon after graduation I was contacted by a company called Genesis Dev10 where they were supposed to pay me to learn and then place me in a job. I applied but it never felt right to me because the contract was horrible and the pay was so low to have to live in such expensive cities. However, I still applied for the job but ended up intentionally bombing the interview project after talking with a freind in the field. It was my freind who convinced me to do a bootcamp and this is what lead me to Coding Temple.
